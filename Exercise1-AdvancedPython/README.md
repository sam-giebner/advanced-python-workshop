# Exercise 1: Increasing Modularity and Readability. 

## 1. Create a function that:
  - Takes in a list of zip codes as a parameter.
  - Takes in an address as a string parameter.
  - Outputs:
      - True - Address parameter contains a zip code found in the zip code list.
      - False - Address paprameter does not contain a zip code found in zip code list.
  - Uses appropriatly named objects (functions, variables, etc.).
  - Uses guard clauses to reduce indentation levels.
  - Optionally: 
      - Document the function using a doc string.
      - Handle errors using try/except statements.
      - Use a main function to control logic.
 
## 2.  Execute the function using named variables

### Hints:
- 'my_list' - contains zip codes found in Beltrami County.
- 'test' - contains Paul Bunyan's address as a string.
