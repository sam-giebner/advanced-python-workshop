## Description
The ability to generate custom maps or reports in an automated fashion has a variety of uses and applications: from web services to desktop applications to map series. This first portion of this workshop will cover some more advanced topics like classes, custom modules, collaboration and source control. In the second half of the workshop we will put these skills to work and learn how to generate PDFs using Python. If time allows, Tony will show you how to build a house with your bare hands.
